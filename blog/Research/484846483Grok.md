Searching for a topic.
This is for Charlie Kirk. Especially the shooting at UVU on Sept 
10th, 2025. The goal is to research the specified topic search X 
posts
Need as much information as possible. If it is 20 pages long, 
then that is fine. Focus on as many claims of facts or 
analysis that are specific. Or theories. 
Find everything for that topic. I'll put the results as

Everything on Flight or Plane N1098L
N1098L is a Bombardier Global 6500 aircraft registered to Lasai Aviation II LLC, a subsidiary of 
Leidos Holdings, Inc., a U.S. defense contractor specializing in intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance (ISR) missions for the U.S. Army. [Source: Web Article.

N1098L is part of the U.S. Army's HADES (High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System) 
program, designed for deep sensing, including SIGINT, ELINT, radar, EO/IR sensors, and 
capable of drone deployment. [Source: X Post.

On September 10, 2025, N1098L departed from Biggs Army Airfield in El Paso, Texas, at 
approximately 7:48 a.m. MDT, en route to Glacier Park International Airport in Kalispell, 
Montana, arriving at 10:38 a.m. MDT. [Source: Web Article. https://people.com/owner-of-
plane-at-center-of-charlie-kirk-shooting-conspiracy-speaks-out-11808572]
During the flight on September 10, 2025, N1098L descended to unusually low altitudes of 
around 200-600 feet above ground level (AGL) near Utah Lake and the UVU campus, 
approximately 1-2 miles from the site of Charlie Kirk's shooting. [Source: X Post. 
https://x.com/I_Am_JohnCullen/status/1970561850308776391]
The low-altitude passes occurred twice: first around 9:16 a.m. MDT, before the shooting at 
approximately 12:20 p.m. MDT, and again around 12:48 p.m. MDT, 24-28 minutes after the 
shooting. [Source: X Post. https://x.com/I_Am_JohnCullen/status/1977504843410309325]
During these descents, N1098L slowed to speeds of 113-118 knots, which is near stall speed 
for the aircraft, behavior atypical for high-altitude ISR operations. [Source: X Post.

The aircraft's maneuvers on September 10, 2025, included descending from 41,000 feet to 
203-204 feet AGL adjacent to the UVU campus, sparking speculation about surveillance or 
drone operations. [Source: X Post. 
https://x.com/I_Am_JohnCullen/status/1974815436144365734]
N1098L is equipped for launching and retrieving drones, and multiple unidentified aerial 
vehicles (UAVs) were reportedly observed at the UVU scene around the time of the shooting.

The flight path on September 10, 2025, was a repositioning flight, but the repeated low-
altitude deviations over the UVU area are considered anomalous and not standard for training 
or routine operations. [Source: X Post. https://x.com/quaeriteX/status/1977160691091149124]
N1098L has a history of flights between Kalispell, Montana, and El Paso, Texas, with similar 
low-altitude maneuvers on five occasions over the past year, but the dual passes at Provo on 
September 10, 2025, are unique. [Source: X Post.

On September 23, 2025, N1098L flew from El Paso to Washington state, but the flight was not 
publicly listed, raising questions about its purpose. [Source: X Post.

the incident. [Source: X Post. https://x.com/AngelaWinn51203/status/1977482717437821142]
N1098L was observed flying over Provo again on October 9, 2025, and then to Salinas, 
California, a location with drone test facilities. [Source: X Post.

The aircraft's presence twice at low altitude near UVU on the day of the shooting has fueled 
theories of military or CIA involvement in Charlie Kirk's assassination, including potential 
monitoring, recording, or direct participation. [Source: X Post.

N1098L is not an ISR/HADES-equipped spy plane but is used for training future HADES pilots, 
with noted unusual descent maneuvers possibly related to steep approach certification.

Alongside N1098L, another surveillance aircraft, N55906, was airborne above the UVU scene

The HADES program, associated with N1098L, includes capabilities for 360-degree threat 
detection, multi-domain sensing, and real-time data fusion, typically operating at high

On September 29, 2025, N1098L flew past UVU at 41,000 feet without descending, 
contrasting its behavior on September 10. [Source: X Post.

Flight data indicates N1098L's low passes could suggest coordination with other flights, 
including Egyptian aircraft SU-BTT and SU-BND present in the area. [Source: X Post.

The aircraft's sale listing as a 2023 Bombardier Global 6500 confirms its specifications, 
including high endurance and payload for ISR modifications. [Source: Web Article.
