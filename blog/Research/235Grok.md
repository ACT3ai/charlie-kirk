Robinson was seen in a parking lot near UVU about 20 minutes after the shooting in new 
CCTV footage. 
Candace Owens has claimed Robinson was not on the UVU campus on the day of the 
shooting, contradicting official accounts. 
Conspiracy theories suggest involvement of others, including FBI suppression of evidence or 
ties to CIA, but official investigations indicate Robinson acted alone. 
No autopsy details or bullet from Kirk's body have been released, fueling speculation. 
Robinson's parents are in hiding due to death threats following the incident. @TheDibsterX
Robinson is due back in court on October 30, 2025. foxnews.com
