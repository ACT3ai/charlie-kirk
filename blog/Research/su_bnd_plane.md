Searching for a topic.
This is for Charlie Kirk. Especially the shooting at UVU on Sept 
10th, 2025. The goal is to research the specified topic search X 
posts
Need as much information as possible. If it is 20 pages long, 
then that is fine. Focus on as many claims of facts or 
analysis that are specific. Or theories. 
Find everything for that topic. I'll put the results as 
markdown file.
Finding results in X Posts is good, but also search the 
internet.
Include the source on where it was found.
