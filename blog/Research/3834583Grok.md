Searching for a topic.
This is for Charlie Kirk. Especially the shooting at UVU on Sept 
10th, 2025. The goal is to research the specified topic search X 
posts
Need as much information as possible. If it is 20 pages long, 
then that is fine. Focus on as many claims of facts or 
analysis that are specific. Or theories. 
Find everything for that topic. I'll put the results as

Finding results in X Posts is good, but also search the 
internet.
Include the source on where it was found.
The format of a source should be on the same line at the 
end.

Video. https://x.com/@foo/post32/]
Output the results that are factual claims.
Look for a file in the directory 
~/Dropbox/Code/act3/charlie-kirk/blog/Research/

Make these files markdown file formats with a file extension 
".md"
Work on making a bullet point per factual claim. Include the
