The Topic is: Everything on flight or plane with tail number "SU-

should be included, even if no reference to Charlie Kirk or that 
date.
Searching for a topic.
This is for Charlie Kirk. Especially the shooting at UVU on Sept 
10th, 2025. The goal is to research the specified topic search X 
posts
Need as much information as possible. If it is 20 pages long, 
then that is fine. Focus on as many claims of facts or 
analysis that are specific. Or theories. 
Find everything for that topic. I'll put the results as 
markdown file.
Finding results in X Posts is good, but also search the 
internet.
Include the source on where it was found.
The format of a source should be on the same line at the 
end.
Example sources:
X happened on June 13th, 2025. [Source: X Post. 
https://x.com/@foo/post32/]
Y happened on April 13th, 2025. [Source: Article. 
https://artcilefoo.com/@foo/post32/]
Z happened on Sept 13th, 2025. [Source: YouTube 
Video. https://x.com/@foo/post32/]
Output the results that are factual claims.
Look for a file in the directory
