The bullet captured in video is post-exit, fixing inconsistencies and easier to capture as it's 
moving slower. @ZebBoykin [Source: X Post.

The large hole on Charlie Kirk's neck is an exit wound, possibly with a smaller entrance on the 
shirt, but needs more evidence. @ZebBoykin [Source: X Post.

Proof the bullet didn't stop where claimed, showing direct localized expansion from the round,

Open to the possibility of a front shot on Charlie Kirk, as it would answer inconsistencies, but 
confirms the large hole as exit. @ZebBoykin [Source: X Post.

Candace Owens claims Tyler Robinson wasn’t on the UVU campus during the shooting and 
the FBI is lying. @thesoulsinga [Source: X Post. 
https://x.com/ZebBoykin/status/1971646000776597950]
Videos of Tyler Robinson don’t match the profile given, and it's near impossible to affirm he 
was never on campus, but evidence suggests he wasn’t there during the shooting.

Dismiss theories like 'phone gun', 'camera gun', or 'signals' as wastes of time; only one slip-up 
found, not the shooter's fault. @ZebBoykin [Source: X Post.

How did the surgeon find the bullet if it was already recovered? The coverup is incoherent.

Candace Owens is claiming the round was something other than .30-06, possibly a pistol 
given no exit. @ZebBoykin [Source: X Post.

For an entry wound to be that large would require insane force, with tissue painted on the wall 
behind; nothing tangible supports that. @ZebBoykin [Source: X Post.

No idea on effects of a liquid round, but it would likely mean less cavity and no immediate 
incapacitation force. @ZebBoykin [Source: X Post.

They assassinated an Old Stock Christian American (Charlie Kirk) and replaced him with a

Netanyahu blamed Muslims for Charlie Kirk's death, calling it a worldwide problem of radical 
Islamists and ultra-progressives using violence. @krystalball [Source: X Post.

Netanyahu's insertion into the Charlie Kirk narrative is bizarre; he's been on podcasts mirroring 
Kirk's questioning. @krystalball [Source: X Post.

Asking questions killed Charlie Kirk? Linked to texts about losing Jewish donors over not

Charlie Kirk was disgusted by antisemitism but was race-pilling young White men, promoting 
White unity as a White Christian. @deutschristen [Source: X Post.

Charlie Kirk just needed a little more time; asking questions may have led to his death.

Would a ballistics breakdown of the Charlie Kirk assassination qualify as antisemitic?
