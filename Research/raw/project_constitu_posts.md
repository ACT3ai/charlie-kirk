The sound of the shot came from below the eyewitness to the right, in the audience section, 
punching upward directly to his ears. [Source: X Post. 
https://x.com/ProjectConstitu/status/1977209967485546880] @ProjectConstitu
There was no echo from the shot due to the crowd and clothes absorbing the sound like a 
trap. [Source: X Post. https://x.com/ProjectConstitu/status/1977209967485546880] 
@ProjectConstitu
The sound felt like it rose upward, ruling out a roof or balcony origin because the canopy 
would block the view and angle. [Source: X Post.

The trajectory of the shot was at eye level with no ricochet or external noise. [Source: X Post.

Theory: The shot was from a concealed remote device at the top inside the tent/canopy, 
triggered wirelessly for precision. [Source: X Post.

Demand for forensics on tent fixtures before teardown to expose who planted the device.
