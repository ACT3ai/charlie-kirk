- FAA Part 107 generally limits small UAS to fly at or below 400 feet above ground level (AGL) and requires maintaining visual line of sight (VLOS), unless the operator has an FAA waiver for specific operations. [Source: FAA Part 107 Summary. https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/part_107/]

- Under the 2021 final rule, remote pilots may fly at night if the aircraft has anti-collision lighting visible for at least 3 statute miles and the pilot has completed updated knowledge testing/training.

- Operations over people are allowed under Categories 1–4 when specific aircraft and operational requirements are met (e.g., weight or injury threshold limits, means of compliance, declaration of compliance).

- Remote ID is required for most drones operating in the U.S. National Airspace System; compliance has been enforceable since March 16, 2024. Operations without Remote ID are permitted only in FAA-Recognized Identification Areas (FRIAs) or with a Remote ID broadcast module (when applicable).

- Recreational flyers must pass The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) and carry proof of passage when flying for recreational purposes in the U.S. [Source: FAA TRUST. https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test]

- LAANC provides near real-time airspace authorizations for controlled airspace at participating airports, enabling compliant flights at or below pre-approved grids. [Source: FAA LAANC. https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/laanc]

- Drones weighing 0.55 lb (250 g) or more must be registered with the FAA prior to operation; registration markings must be displayed and the certificate carried. [Source: FAA Drone Registration. https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/registration]

- Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations generally require specific FAA approval (e.g., waiver or exemption); FAA is developing a BVLOS rule informed by the BVLOS ARC recommendations. [Source: FAA BVLOS (ARC/Rulemaking). https://www.faa.gov/uas/advanced_operations/bvlos]
