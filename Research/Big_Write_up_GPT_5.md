# Charlie Kirk Assassination Research

## Overview

Charlie Kirk was assassinated on September 10th, 2025, at Utah Valley University (UVU). The government’s official narrative claims it was a lone-wolf attack carried out by Tyler Robinson. However, multiple pieces of evidence suggest that Robinson’s weapon—a 30-06 Mauser 98—could not have inflicted the wound patterns observed. Various accounts, reports, and online investigations indicate potential involvement by intelligence services, drone operations, and political motives.

Kirk’s Turning Point USA (TPUSA) organization is a politically strategic entity, influential among conservative youth and university students. As Kirk began expressing dissenting views toward Israel and its influence on U.S. policy, speculation grew about international motives behind his assassination. This document compiles all details, timelines, actors, theories, and investigations drawn from the uploaded research files.
