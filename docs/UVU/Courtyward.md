# UVU Courtyard

## Overview

This page focuses on the **UVU courtyard area** where the event took place, including its layout, surrounding structures, and how it factors into analyses of shooter positions, security posture, and witness perspectives. It does not assert a specific origin of the shot; instead, it explains why the courtyard and its immediate surroundings are central to many theories and reconstructions.

## Layout and surrounding structures

Key features of the courtyard environment include:

- The **tent and stage** area where Charlie spoke, with audience seating and standing zones extending outward.
- Nearby **buildings, walkways, and tunnels** that provide both vantage points and potential cover, such as balconies, stairwells, and elevated walkways.
- **Ingress and egress paths** used by attendees, staff, and security, which appear in various videos and are referenced in movement timelines.

Understanding the spatial relationships among these elements is essential for evaluating claims about line of sight, distances, and the feasibility of different shooter locations.

## Courtyard in witness footage and analysis

Multiple videos and photos capture the courtyard from different angles, showing:

- Crowd movement and reactions at the moment of the shot and immediately afterward.
- The positioning of **security personnel, cameras, and production equipment** around the tent and along the courtyard edges.
- Background activity in the **tunnel and adjacent building areas**, which some analysts highlight when discussing potential alternative shooter positions.

Analysts use these visual records to build 2D and 3D reconstructions, attempt to synchronize audio and video, and test whether proposed trajectories fit the courtyard geometry.

## Relationship to other investigative topics

The UVU courtyard is where many investigative threads converge:

- Shooter‑location theories (rooftop, tent, vehicle, balcony) are all evaluated relative to this space.
- Security and law‑enforcement questions—such as patrol patterns, rooftop checks, and perimeter control—play out in and around the courtyard.
- Drone and aircraft analyses often reference how aerial views relate to the courtyard layout and crowd distribution.
