WHISTLEBLOWER ALERT: Utah's Secret SOCIAL MEDIA CENSORSHIP PLOT To Bury Charlie Kirk's ASSASSINATION!

Utah power players are SLIPPING THROUGH a sneaky social media bill (SB 194/HB 464 revisions, fast-tracked in 2025 session) under the radar—framed as "kid safety" but DESIGNED to let officials & suspects WIPE OUT any online talk of murder investigations. We're talking TOTAL CONTROL: censor posts, delete threads, shadowban truth-seekers exposing the web of corruption tied to Charlie Kirk's brutal hit in September!

Think about it: Charlie Kirk, the fearless conservative firebrand, gunned down in broad daylight. And who benefits? The SAME UTAH ELITE—politicos, donors, insiders—with shady links to the case. Our Charlie Kirk Investigative Committee has been DIGGING DEEP: suspicious alibis, backroom deals, officials' families popping up in flight logs & donor lists. We've POSTED IT ALL—photos, timelines, connections that scream COVER-UP.

But this bill? It hands THEM the kill switch. "Privacy protections" = excuse to scrub EVERYTHING about Kirk's murder. No more viral exposés on the assassin’s ties to state-funded ops. No more sleuthing squads like ours dropping receipts on the power brokers who KNEW and did NOTHING. It's a DIRECT ASSAULT on our 1st Amendment—state-sponsored censorship to protect killers & cronies!

This isn't "regulation"—it's a BLACKOUT on justice! Utah's trying to pass it QUIETLY to dodge the spotlight, but WE SEE YOU. If this flies, say goodbye to free speech on ANY high-profile hit. They silenced Kirk—now they're coming for YOUR VOICE.
