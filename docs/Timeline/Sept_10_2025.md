# September 10, 2025 – Day‑of Timeline (Reported Facts and Claims)

## Overview

This Level_3 page expands on the **day‑of timeline for September 10, 2025**, when Charlie Kirk was shot at Utah Valley University (UVU). It brings together:

- **Reported events** from law‑enforcement statements and local/national news coverage, and  
- **Additional details and interpretations (claims)** from citizen‑investigator work based on doorbell/security‑camera clips, police‑audio recordings, and flight‑tracking data.

Nothing here should be read as assigning guilt to any individual or organization. Where events or times rely on citizen‑compiled material, they are labeled as **claims** and attributed to the type of public source (e.g., X posts, YouTube breakdowns, Substack timelines).

## Core incident timeline (as reported)

Public reporting and law‑enforcement briefings describe the following approximate sequence on September 10, 2025:

- **Morning – Tyler Robinson sightings near UVU (as reported):**  
  - Around **8:07 AM MDT** – A Ring doorbell camera records an individual identified in reports as Tyler Robinson walking on **S 800 W** toward campus.  
  - Around **8:23 AM** – A WYZE camera on **W 880 S** captures him driving in the area.  
  - Around **8:29 AM** – UVU surveillance footage reportedly shows his vehicle entering campus.  
  - Around **9:57 AM** – Another WYZE clip shows him walking again on **W 880 S**.  
- **Late morning – clothing change (as reported):**  
  - Media summaries and research notes drawing on these clips state that Robinson appears later in **jeans and a long‑sleeve shirt**, indicating an outfit change sometime between 9:57 AM and late morning.  
  - Around **11:44 AM** – A Ring camera records him walking on **W 800 S**.  
  - Around **11:49 AM** – Ring footage shows him again on **S 800 W**, reportedly heading back toward campus.  
- **Shooting window (as reported):**  
  - **12:23 PM MDT** – Most sources, including timelines built from police‑audio time stamps, place the **shot** at approximately this time during Charlie’s speech under the event tent at UVU.  
  - **12:26 PM MDT** – Dispatch audio and news reports state that the **first police report** of the shooting was logged around this time.  
  - Time‑of‑death references in media vary slightly (e.g., 12:23–12:27 PM MDT).

These entries are based on **doorbell and security‑camera clips described in news coverage**, as well as time stamps cited in police‑audio compilations posted by journalists and commentators.

## Additional timing details from citizen‑investigator compilations (claims)

Citizen investigators have produced more granular day‑of timelines using synchronized video, audio, and scanner feeds. Their key claimed refinements include:

- **Exact shot timing and roof activity (claims):**  
  - Some compilations argue that the **fatal shot** must have been at or just after **12:23 PM** based on synchronized audio and video; they note that certain descriptions of Robinson allegedly **“jumping off the roof”** around that same minute appear in commentary, and question whether this squares with official time‑of‑death ranges.  
  - These assertions are drawn from **unofficial audio transcripts and multi‑angle video breakdowns** shared on X and YouTube, not from certified court records.
- **Sequence of movements immediately before and after the shot (claims):**  
  - Frame‑by‑frame analysis of crowd and security movements, including close‑protection personnel, is used to propose alternative shooter locations (e.g., tent‑interior, nearby van) and to highlight specific individuals’ positions at the moment of impact.  
  - These interpretations are discussed in more detail on the [Close‑Range Theories](/Killer/Close_Range_Theories.md) and [Patsies and Distraction Actors](/Killer/Patsies_Distraction_Actors.md) pages and remain disputed.

Because these refinements rely on **privately compiled timelines** and community analyses, they should be treated as **hypotheses**, not as authoritative chronologies.

## Day‑of aviation and vehicle activity (claims)

Several publicly available flight‑tracking records and aviation‑analysis videos are used to add an **aerial and vehicle layer** to the September 10 timeline:

- **HADES N1098L (claims):**  
  - ADS‑B/Flightradar‑style screenshots, cited by researchers and aviation‑oriented commentators, show the U.S. Army‑linked Bombardier Global 6500 **N1098L** (associated with the HADES ISR program) flying at high altitude but executing **low‑altitude, low‑speed passes** near Utah Lake and the UVU area.  
  - One pass is said to occur around **11:47 AM MDT** (roughly an hour before the shooting), and another around **12:24–12:48 PM MDT** (after the shot). Exact times vary by source. These claims are discussed in more detail at [N1098L](/Planes/N1098L/overview.md) and on [Planes](/Planes/overview.md).  
- **Private jet N888KG (claims):**  
  - Videos and posts by aviation trackers (for example, popular channels that specialize in reading ADS‑B/FAA data) allege that a private jet with tail number **N888KG** departed **Provo Municipal Airport (PVU)** on the evening of September 10, flew southeast, **disabled its ADS‑B transponder mid‑flight**, and later re‑appeared on public radar before returning to PVU.  
  - These reconstructions are based on **public flight‑tracking logs** and commentary segments; no official agency has publicly described this flight as connected to the shooting.  
- **Dairy Queen sighting (claims):**  
  - Social‑media posts and media appearances (including commentary from Candace Owens) reference a purported **Dairy Queen sighting in Orem** showing a person claimed to be Robinson in the early evening—often cited around **6:38 PM MDT**—and in some earlier versions as close as **12:38 PM MDT** after the shooting.  
  - These accounts rely on **single photographs and timestamp annotations** shared online; they have not been fully adjudicated in court.

These aviation and movement details are part of broader operational theories, not stand‑alone proof of any particular shooter or conspiracy.

## Disputed elements and open questions

Across the September 10 timeline, several **points of disagreement** recur in public discussions:

- **Exact shot and death times:** whether official time stamps and citizen‑compiled audio align on the precise moment of impact.  
- **Feasibility of Tyler Robinson’s movements:** whether the recorded camera sightings, roof access, and any off‑site appearances (such as Dairy Queen) are collectively plausible within the time windows described.  
- **Significance of aircraft activity:** whether N1098L’s low passes and N888KG’s reported transponder behavior are ordinary for training/charter operations, or meaningful in the context of the shooting.  

These questions are explored in more detail in [Timeline](/Timeline/overview.md), [Planes](/Planes/overview.md), [Drones](/Drones/overview.md), and [Tyler Robinson](/Tyler_Robinson/overview.md). Readers should distinguish carefully between **officially documented time stamps** and **community‑generated reconstructions and theories**.
