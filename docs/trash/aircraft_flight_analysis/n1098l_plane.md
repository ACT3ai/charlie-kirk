## September 10, 2025 Flight Analysis

### Flight Path and Timeline
- **Departure**: Biggs Army Airfield (El Paso, Texas) at 7:48 a.m. MDT
- **Destination**: Glacier Park International Airport (Kalispell, Montana)
- **Arrival**: 10:38 a.m. MDT
- **Total Flight Time**: 2 hours 50 minutes

### Anomalous Behavior Near UVU
The aircraft exhibited highly unusual behavior during its flight:

#### First Descent (9:16 a.m. MDT)
- Descended from 41,000 feet to approximately 203-204 feet AGL
- Location: Adjacent to Utah Valley University campus
- Distance: 1-2 miles from Charlie Kirk shooting site
- Speed: Reduced to 113-118 knots (near stall speed)
- Purpose: Suspected drone deployment

#### Second Descent (12:48 p.m. MDT)
- Occurred 24-28 minutes after Charlie Kirk's assassination (12:23 p.m. MDT)
- Descended to 335 feet AGL at 129 knots
- Location: Same area near UVU campus
- Purpose: Suspected drone retrieval

### Surveillance Capabilities
N1098L is equipped with:
- Advanced ISR sensors
- Drone launch and retrieval systems
- Real-time data transmission capabilities
- Multi-spectral imaging systems

## Connection to Charlie Kirk Assassination

### Timeline Correlation
- **9:16 a.m.**: First low-altitude pass (drone deployment)
- **12:23 p.m.**: Charlie Kirk assassinated at UVU
- **12:48 p.m.**: Second low-altitude pass (drone retrieval)

### Suspicious Circumstances
1. **Unprecedented Maneuvers**: The dual low-altitude passes over UVU are unique in N1098L's flight history
2. **Timing**: Both passes occurred on the exact day and location of the assassination
3. **Speed Reduction**: Descending to stall speed is atypical for high-altitude ISR operations
4. **Drone Capability**: Aircraft can deploy and retrieve drones, matching witness reports of UAVs at the scene

### Witness Reports
Multiple witnesses reported seeing:
- Unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) at the UVU scene
- Drones flying at high speeds (150 mph) that were difficult to see
- Military-style surveillance equipment

## Intelligence Connections

### Leidos Holdings
- Major U.S. defense contractor
- Specializes in intelligence and surveillance
- Has contracts with multiple government agencies
- Known for classified operations

### HADES Program
- Part of U.S. Army's advanced ISR capabilities
- Designed for deep sensing and threat detection
- Capable of drone operations
- Typically operates at high altitudes

## Alternative Explanations

### Official Narrative
- **Training Mission**: Some sources claim N1098L was used for training future HADES pilots
- **Steep Approach Certification**: Unusual descents may have been for pilot certification
- **Repositioning Flight**: Routine movement between military facilities

### Counter-Arguments
- Training flights don't typically involve dual low-altitude passes over civilian areas
- Steep approach certification wouldn't require such specific timing
- No other HADES aircraft exhibited similar behavior

## Investigation Status

### FBI Response
- Initially unaware of N1098L's flight path
- No acknowledgment of drone operations
- Limited cooperation with flight data requests

### Public Records
- Flight tracking data publicly available
- No classified information released
- Crew details remain confidential

## Conspiracy Theories

### Mossad Involvement
- Theories suggest Israeli intelligence coordination
- N1098L's capabilities could support foreign operations
- Timing suggests pre-planned surveillance

### CIA Rogue Faction
- National Counter-Terrorism Center sources suggest CIA involvement
- HADES program capabilities match assassination method
- Similar to Butler, PA attack patterns

### Government Cover-up
- Secrecy surrounding crew and mission details
- Limited public information about HADES program
- Potential classified operations

## Technical Analysis

### Flight Data
- ADS-B tracking shows precise altitude and speed changes
- GPS coordinates confirm proximity to UVU
- Weather conditions were clear, no operational necessity for low altitude

### Drone Capabilities
- X-65 DARPA drones can be air-dropped from Global Express
- Capable of precision targeting
- Can be retrieved mid-flight
- Silent operation at high speeds

## Conclusion

The N1098L flight on September 10, 2025, represents one of the most compelling pieces of evidence in the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation. The aircraft's unprecedented dual low-altitude passes over UVU, combined with its advanced surveillance and drone capabilities, create a strong circumstantial case for government involvement in the assassination.

The timing correlation between the aircraft's maneuvers and the shooting, along with witness reports of drones at the scene, suggests a coordinated operation that goes far beyond the official narrative of a lone gunman. The classified nature of the HADES program and the limited public information about N1098L's operations only add to the suspicion surrounding this case.

Further investigation into the crew members, mission authorization, and specific capabilities deployed during this flight could provide crucial evidence about the true nature of Charlie Kirk's assassination.
