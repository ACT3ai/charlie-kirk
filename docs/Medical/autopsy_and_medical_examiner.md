TOPIC: Autopsy, Utah medical examiner system, legal access to records

### Summary
Utah uses a state medical examiner system (not coroners). Dr. Deirdre Amaro is listed as chief medical examiner as of July 1, 2025. Autopsy details are withheld under Utah GRAMA during active investigations. Claims exist of a newly appointed examiner (Angela Hammond) in Sept 2025, but no official records confirm this.

### Utah ME Framework and Access
- Utah doesn’t use a coroner; it uses a state medical examiner.
- Medical examiner reports are withheld from the public during criminal cases, especially active capital homicide investigations.
- Death certificates are issued, but certified copies are restricted and don’t become public for 50 years.
- Ballistics and autopsy materials are private during active investigations per GRAMA.

### Reported Personnel and Appointments
- Chief Medical Examiner: Deirdre Amaro (as of July 1, 2025).  
- Claim: Angela Hammond newly appointed in Sept 2025; no official confirmation found.  

### Allegations and Questions
- Allegation of no autopsy or suppressed access; calls to verify what was performed and when.
- Calls to release autopsy photos are moot due to SB0082 (Autopsy Photo Amendments) effective May 7, 2025, criminalizing distribution of ME photos.

### Utah SB0082 (Autopsy Photo Amendments)
- Introduced Jan 9, 2025; effective May 7, 2025.  
- Criminalizes sharing of autopsy photographs in ME records (Class B misdemeanor unless public domain).  
- Limits access to ME records to relatives, legal reps, physicians, law enforcement, and researchers under conditions.  
- Note: Online chatter links drafting attorney Greg Gunn to pre-incident search spikes; unverified.

### Open Items
- Confirm whether an autopsy was conducted and the scope of examinations.  
- Clarify ME personnel roles and chain of custody for reports and evidence.  
- Request lawful release of non-restricted summaries per GRAMA.
