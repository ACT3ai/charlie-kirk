TOPIC: Lapel mic or IEM explosive, amplified gunshot audio, speaker hum

### Summary
Claims suggest a secondary mechanism via an explosive in Kirk’s lapel mic or in-ear monitor (IEM), potentially amplified by the PA system. Others suggest an audio gunshot cue or overdriven mic causing a “super close” gunshot perception.

### Reported Indicators
- Lapel mic/IEM explosive hypothesis: PBXN-like low-flash explosive, RF-triggered; wire snap motion observed; necklace severing; chest/neck expansion; no visible flash.  
- Speaker system anomalies: audible hum before the question; possible pre-mixed gunshot played over speakers.  
- “Everyone heard a gunshot” close by; sound analysis claims proximity within ~36 ft (unverified).  

### Evidence To Collect
- Original multi-track audio from event mixers and camera sources.  
- High-FPS video of IEM wire motion and mic hardware pre/post incident.  
- Forensic exam of mic/transmitter, IEM components, and clothing artifacts.  

### Open Items
- Confirm presence/absence of explosive residues on mic/IEM.  
- Correlate audio impulses with video frames to determine origin and propagation.  
- Validate or refute loudspeaker injection hypotheses.
