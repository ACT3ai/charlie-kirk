TOPIC: Bullet caliber, entry/exit path, wound characteristics, alternatives

### Summary
Official claim: a 30‑06 Mauser 98 fired from a rooftop. Counterpoints argue wound morphology inconsistent with high-energy .30‑06 (expected catastrophic neck trauma and heavy back-spray). Alternate: 9mm +P from an Israeli CornerShot fired inside the tent; cavitation explains necklace snap and pugilist posture.

### Reported Observations
- Front wound debated as exit vs entry; lack of extensive back-spray onto backdrop.  
- Necklace severing and upward motion noted.  
- Shell casing allegedly seen rolling from tent tarp area.  

### Competing Hypotheses
- Rooftop 30‑06 shot from east (official).  
- Closer-range 9mm +P from CornerShot inside tent (alternative).  
- Compressed-air gunshot acoustics theories and/or multiple shots timing claims.  

### Needed Forensic Work
- Full autopsy findings: wound path, caliber determination, residue.  
- Scene reconstruction with LOS and angle analysis from south stairwell/door and tent positions.  
- Ballistic gel and material tests matching reported distances and barriers.  

### Open Items
- Recover and authenticate any shell casing claimed in videos.  
- Publish ballistic trajectory and tissue damage analysis correlating with medical records.  
- Reconcile audio crack–thump timing with hypothesized shooter locations.
