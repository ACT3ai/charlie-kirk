# Medical Analysis

## Overview
This section covers **medical, forensic, and hospital‑related questions** surrounding the Charlie Kirk case. It does not provide medical advice or replace official medical documents. Instead, it organizes how public reporting and commentary discuss autopsy issues, hospital choice and treatment, wound characteristics, and potential data or site‑change concerns, and links to Level 3 pages where each topic is explored in more detail.

## Key medical and forensic topics

The `Medical` section is structured around several focused pages:

- **Autopsy and medical examiner framework** – see [autopsy_and_medical_examiner.md](./autopsy_and_medical_examiner.md) for discussion of autopsy practices, legal constraints, and reported questions about what has and has not been released.
- **Hospital and emergency response** – see [hospital_and_emergency_response.md](./hospital_and_emergency_response.md) for analyses of transport decisions, facility capabilities, and how the response aligns with standard trauma protocols.
- **Lapel mic and audio theories** – see [lapel_mic_and_audio_theories.md](./lapel_mic_and_audio_theories.md) for claims about how audio equipment may relate to sound signatures or injury patterns.
- **Ballistics and wound analysis** – see [ballistics_and_wound_analysis.md](./ballistics_and_wound_analysis.md) for discussion of wound characteristics, entry/exit debates, and how they intersect with shooter‑location and caliber theories.
- **Data manipulation and cell forensics** – see [data_manipulation_and_cell_forensics.md](./data_manipulation_and_cell_forensics.md) for claims about how digital medical or phone data may have been handled.
- **Construction and site changes** – see [construction_and_site_changes.md](./construction_and_site_changes.md) for analysis of post‑incident physical alterations and their potential impact on medical and forensic interpretation.

Each of these pages aims to clearly distinguish between **documented facts**, **expert interpretations**, and **unverified hypotheses**.

## Medical analysis in the broader investigation

Medical and forensic questions are central because they can clarify or challenge claims about:

- The **direction, distance, and nature of the shot** or shots.
- The **timing and adequacy of emergency care**, including whether different choices could have altered outcomes.
- How wound characteristics relate to proposed **weapons, devices, or shooter locations**.

To place medical analysis in context, readers should consider it alongside sections such as `Timeline`, `Shooting_Locations`, `Charlie/Autopsy`, and `Killer`. As more verified medical information becomes available through official channels, this section can be updated to reflect a clearer evidentiary picture while preserving the distinction between evidence and theory.
