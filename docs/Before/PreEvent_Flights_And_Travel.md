# Pre‑Event Flights and Travel Around Utah (Claims)

## Overview

This Level_3 page summarizes **claims about aircraft and travel activity in the days leading up to the UVU event**, focusing on:

- Egyptian military aircraft such as **SU‑BTT**,  
- The U.S. Army‑linked ISR jet **N1098L**, and  
- Private jet movements like **N888KG**.

These details come from **flight‑tracking data (e.g., ADS‑B Exchange/Flightradar‑style sites), aviation‑spotter discussions, and commentary by media figures** including Candace Owens and various online analysts. They are presented as **claims about possible context**, not as proof that any specific flight was part of a criminal plot.

## Egyptian Air Force flights (claims)

Open‑source aviation enthusiasts and citizen‑researchers have compiled logs and screenshots showing **Egyptian Air Force aircraft** operating in or around Utah during 2025:

- **SU‑BTT and related jets (claims):**  
  - Flight‑log compilations shared on X/Twitter and in YouTube videos indicate that **SU‑BTT**, a Gulfstream jet registered to the Egyptian Air Force, made trips to the United States, including a stop at or near **Provo (PVU)**.  
  - According to these compilations, SU‑BTT **arrived around September 4, 2025**, remained in the region through Charlie’s visit, and **departed the U.S. around September 10–11**. Other Egyptian jets (SU‑BND, SU‑BTU, SU‑BTV, SU‑BGM) are also said to have flown into Provo earlier in 2025.  
  - These details are based on **public flight‑tracking logs and aviation‑spotter commentary**, not on official manifests or statements linking the flights to the UVU event.  
- **Counter‑UAS/contractor narratives (claims):**  
  - Some X threads and interview segments reference unnamed sources at aircraft‑service providers (e.g., Duncan Aviation) who allegedly describe **4–6 passengers with Egyptian passports and “U.S. Department of Defense Liaison” badges** and mention **counter‑UAS (unmanned‑aircraft‑system) testing** in the Provo area between September 4–10.  
  - These accounts are anecdotal and have not been corroborated by public documentation.

These flights are used in pre‑event narratives to suggest that **foreign military assets were in the vicinity** before and during Charlie’s visit, but their actual purpose remains unproven in public records.

## N1098L (HADES ISR jet) pre‑event activity (claims)

The **Bombardier Global 6500 N1098L**, associated in defense reporting with the U.S. Army’s **HADES (High Accuracy Detection & Exploitation System)** program, also features in “before” discussions:

- **General role (as reported):**  
  - Defense outlets such as *The War Zone* have reported on the HADES program’s interest in **air‑launched drones and high‑end ISR** using Global 6500‑class business jets.  
  - Public FAA and ADS‑B data link N1098L to LASAI Aviation II LLC, a contractor involved in special‑mission and ISR work.  
- **Flight patterns around September 10 (claims):**  
  - As detailed in [Timeline](/Timeline/Sept_10_2025.md) and [Planes](/Planes/overview.md), citizen‑researchers assert that on September 10 N1098L flew at high altitude but conducted **low‑altitude, low‑speed passes** near Utah Lake and the UVU area, one **before** and one **after** the shooting.  
  - Some threads also reference earlier flights in 2025, including routes to and from military installations, as part of a broader picture of HADES testing.

These claims are used to argue that **U.S. ISR assets were active in the region around the time of the event**, but there is no public official statement that N1098L was tasked in relation to Charlie or the UVU event.

## Private jet N888KG and pre/post‑event movements (claims)

Another recurring element in pre‑ and post‑event travel discussions is the private jet **N888KG**:

- **Evening departure and transponder behavior (claims):**  
  - Aviation‑tracking commentators, including YouTube channels that specialize in ADS‑B analysis, report that **N888KG** departed **Provo Municipal Airport** on the evening of September 10, flying generally southeast.  
  - These reconstructions assert that the jet’s **ADS‑B transponder was disabled mid‑flight** for a period, causing it to disappear from public tracking before reappearing and eventually returning to PVU.  
  - Disabling ADS‑B without special authorization can violate FAA rules, but public reporting has not shown any enforcement action or official explanation tied to this specific flight.  
- **Speculative interpretations:**  
  - Some commentators suggest the dark segment could have allowed a **remote drop‑off or rendezvous** at a smaller airfield. Others caution that equipment issues or mis‑logged data can also produce tracking gaps.

As with the Egyptian flights, these details are **contextual claims based on open‑source tracking**, not proof of involvement in the crime.

## How pre‑event travel claims fit into the “Before” section

Within the [Before](/Before/overview.md) and [Timeline](/Timeline/overview.md) frameworks:

- These flights are cited to show that **unusual or high‑level aviation activity coincided with Charlie’s Utah trip**, feeding theories of foreign or military‑grade involvement.  
- They also illustrate how **open‑source flight‑tracking data can be used to build timelines**, while reminding readers that correlation does not equal causation.  
- No official investigation has publicly identified any of these flights as part of an assassination plan.

Readers should therefore treat this page as a **summary of claimed travel patterns and aircraft presence before the event**, and cross‑check with more detailed technical and motive discussions in [Planes](/Planes/overview.md), [Motive](/Motive/overview.md), and [Killer](/Killer/overview.md).
