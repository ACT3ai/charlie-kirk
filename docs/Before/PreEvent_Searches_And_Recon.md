# Reported Pre‑Event Searches and Reconnaissance (Claims)

## Overview

This Level_3 page expands on **claims about online searches, reconnaissance, and information‑gathering** that allegedly occurred in the months before the UVU event. These stories rely heavily on:

- **Google Trends screenshots and similar tools**,  
- OSINT‑style write‑ups on Substack and X/Twitter, and  
- Retrospective pattern‑matching that links search topics to people and places later tied to the case.

Because these tools show **only aggregate, anonymized interest** and not who searched or why, all entries here should be treated as **speculative claims**, not as proof that any specific individual or organization conducted reconnaissance for a plot.

For deeper timeline context, see [Timeline 2024](/Timeline/Year_2024.md), [Timeline 2025](/Timeline/Year_2025.md), and [Reported Israeli Search‑Pattern and IP Activity (Claims)](/Israel/Israeli_Search_Patterns_Claims.md).

## Early location and building‑related searches (claims)

Citizen‑research timelines often start with **location‑focused searches**:

- **UVU buildings and layout (claims):**  
  - Google Trends charts shared in X threads and Substack posts suggest that in **August 2024 and into 2025**, there were spikes in searches for terms like **“Utah Valley University buildings,” “UVU Rooftop/Gun/Parking/CCTV/Layout/Losee Center,”** and similar phrases.  
  - Some analysts interpret this as evidence of **advance scouting or reconnaissance** of possible shooter vantage points and surveillance coverage.  
  - Others note that such searches could also reflect academic or general interest, and that Trends data alone cannot show intent.  
- **St. George addresses and “assassin’s pad” narratives (claims):**  
  - Threads also highlight repeated search interest in specific **St. George, Utah addresses** associated with individuals later linked to Tyler Robinson’s social circle, sometimes labeled as an “assassin’s pad.”  
  - These claims are based on correlations between address names and later reporting, rather than on direct logs.

These patterns are part of a broader argument that **key locations were being examined online well before 2025**, but they remain **circumstantial**.

## Searches for medical, legal, and security actors (claims)

Another major pre‑event theme involves **spikes in interest for medical and legal figures** who would later appear in the case:

- **Attorneys and judges (claims):**  
  - Google Trends analyses—often highlighted by commentators like Baron Coleman—report a **one‑week surge in searches for “Kathryn Nester”** (later Tyler Robinson’s defense counsel) between **December 8–14, 2024**, largely from IP addresses in Israel.  
  - Other charts reportedly show attention to Utah judges and prosecutors who would later appear in legal proceedings.  
- **Medical and hospital personnel (claims):**  
  - Aggregated search‑pattern data is also said to show increased interest in:  
    - **Timpanogos Regional Hospital** and other Utah medical facilities,  
    - Specific surgeons and the **Utah state medical examiner**,  
    - Related institutions like **Intermountain Health** and **Dixie Technical College**.  
  - Commentators argue this could signal **pre‑planning of how a potential shooting and its aftermath would be medically and administratively handled**.

Again, these claims rely on **publicly shared Trend graphs**, not on any direct evidence of who performed searches or how many individuals were involved.

## Targeted searches for people in Charlie’s orbit (claims)

Some timelines emphasize searches for **individuals connected to Charlie, TPUSA, or event security**:

- **TPUSA insiders and allies (claims):**  
  - Threads list names such as **Cooper Brown, Dr. Frank Turek, Eric Bolling, Professor Mark Harlin, Jamal Reed, and Jeff Gray**, with claims that search interest in these figures rose in mid‑2025 from particular regions, including Israel and Washington, D.C.  
  - These data points are used to argue that people close to Charlie were being **systematically profiled**.  
- **Potential patsies and security personnel (claims):**  
  - Similar analyses mention searches around figures like **Hunter Kozak**, **Phil Lyman**, and certain security‑related names, suggesting that both potential scapegoats and key witnesses may have been examined in advance.  
  - These interpretations are highly inferential and draw heavily on how post‑event narratives have developed.

These person‑focused searches form part of more complex theories about **who might have been “on the radar” of unknown researchers** before the event.

## How to interpret pre‑event search and recon claims

When evaluating these pre‑event search and reconnaissance ideas:

- **Recognize data limitations:** Aggregate search tools cannot reveal **who** searched or their motives, only that interest in a term fluctuated over time and geography.  
- **Beware hindsight bias:** Once an event occurs, there is a strong temptation to see **any earlier interest** in related terms as predictive or conspiratorial, even when it might not be.  
- **Distinguish correlation from causation:** Elevated search interest around people and places later tied to a case can be coincidental, driven by unrelated factors, or reflective of broader political/media attention.

Within the [Before](/Before/overview.md) section, these claims serve to illustrate **why some investigators believe the UVU event was preceded by sustained research and planning**. They do not, on their own, demonstrate that any specific person, group, or country conducted or directed reconnaissance with criminal intent.
