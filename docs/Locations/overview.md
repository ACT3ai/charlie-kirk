# Locations

## Overview
This page provides a high‑level guide to the **key locations** that appear throughout the Charlie Kirk investigation. It is not an exhaustive atlas, but a way to understand how different places—campus sites, hospitals, airports, businesses, and residential addresses—fit into the broader narrative. Specific location details are developed in topic‑focused sections such as [UVU](/UVU/overview.md), [Maps](maps/overview.md), [Planes](/Planes/overview.md), and [Tyler Robinson](/Tyler_Robinson/overview.md).

## Core locations

Several locations recur in timelines and analyses:

- **Utah Valley University (UVU)** – The campus where the event took place, including the courtyard, tent area, and surrounding buildings.
- **Nearby hospitals and medical facilities** – Sites relevant to emergency response and medical questions after the shooting.
- **Residential locations** linked by reporting to Tyler Robinson, his partner, or other individuals, often in the context of travel routes or alleged planning.

These locations are important for reconstructing movements, response times, and potential vantage points.

## Travel and logistics locations (claims)

Other places enter the investigation through **travel and logistics**:

- **Airports and airfields** connected to flights of interest—both civilian and military‑linked—before and after the event.
- **Businesses and public venues** (such as restaurants or meeting sites) mentioned in timelines or commentary about pre‑event meetings and post‑event sightings.
- **Construction or work sites** where post‑incident alterations occurred, especially around the event area.

These locations are used to test whether specific travel paths, meeting claims, or operational scenarios are plausible.

## Using location information

Readers should use this Locations page as a **navigation aid**:

- For maps and spatial relationships, see [Maps](maps/overview.md) and related diagrams.
- For campus‑specific details, see [UVU](/UVU/overview.md) and [UVU Courtyard](/UVU/Courtyward.md).
- For aviation and long‑distance movements, see [Planes](/Planes/overview.md) and associated subpages.
- For individual‑focused movement and residential addresses, see [Tyler Robinson](/Tyler_Robinson/overview.md) and [Travel](/Tyler/Travel.md).

Location information is most useful when combined with timelines, video evidence, and verified records. As more precise or newly verified location data becomes available, it can be incorporated into the relevant topic pages and referenced from here.
