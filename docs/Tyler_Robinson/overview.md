# Tyler Robinson

## Overview
This page consolidates key claims, timelines, and legal notes related to Tyler Robinson in connection with the Sept 10, 2025 UVU incident involving Charlie Kirk. It reflects material referenced in the main index and compiled notes; many items are disputed or unverified and are presented as claims for investigation, not established fact.

## Position and core claim
- The main page asserts that Tyler Robinson did not shoot Charlie Kirk. The reasoning emphasizes a mismatch between the alleged rifle/caliber and the observed wound pattern, plus alternative shooter hypotheses (e.g., closer shot trajectory, tent/van theories).

## Day-of timeline (claimed)
- Morning sightings attributed to law-enforcement/campus cameras and residential cams:
  - 8:07 – Walking on S 800 W toward campus (Ring camera)
  - 8:23 – Driving on W 880 S (WYZE camera)
  - 8:29 – Driving on campus (UVU surveillance)
  - 9:57 – Walking on W 880 S (WYZE camera)
  - Outfit change reported thereafter (to jeans and long sleeve)
  - 11:44 – Walking on W 800 S (Ring camera)
  - 11:49 – Walking on S 800 W toward campus (Ring camera)
- Time of shot: commonly cited as 12:23 p.m. MDT; first radio report at ~12:26 p.m. (per police audio references).
- Post-incident claim: sighting at Dairy Queen, Orem, at 6:38 p.m. MDT (unverified); questions raised about route, transport, and timing.

## Weapon and ballistics (claims vs. official narrative)
- Claimed official narrative item: recovery of a “high-powered bolt-action rifle” (often described as a Mauser 98 in .30‑06) in a wooded area.
- Counter-claims on mismatch:
  - A .30‑06 at distance would be expected to cause a catastrophic exit and significant spatter inconsistent with observed scene details described by various commentators.
  - Alternative theories argue for a closer shot from the right with a different caliber/energy profile, or a non-rooftop origin.

## Movements and logistics after the event (claims)
- Rifle allegedly disassembled and left near a residence; identity/ownership of that property is contested online.
- Separate claims question whether there was sufficient time for roof egress, stash/disposal, multiple clothing changes, and same-day travel patterns attributed to Robinson.

## Associates and background threads (claims)
- References to a partner (“Lance”), shared residence history, and online activity (Discord/Steam) appear in compiled notes. These items remain unverified and should be treated as leads rather than facts.

## Legal status and proceedings (as compiled)
- Defense team noted in materials: Kathryn N. Nester (lead), Michael N. Burt, and Richard G. Novak. Cost estimates and funding debates are mentioned in commentary but are not official court records here.
- Court items described in commentary:
  - Presiding judge: Tony F. Graf (appointed May 2025; took over Aug 2025). Prior judge: Robert Lunnen (reportedly retired Aug 1, 2025).
  - Broad gag order and closed hearings reported; media access restrictions alleged.
  - A possible “jailhouse informant” (Jaxson Thomas Fox) appearance discussed in commentary; relevance and credibility remain disputed.

## Disputed evidence and investigative questions relevant to Robinson’s culpability
- Camera evidence: Requests for full-release of TPUSA/UVU footage (including drone and stage-facing cameras) to establish shot origin and Robinson’s location/timing.
- Crime scene preservation: Claims that landscaping was replaced/paved within days (including on a Sunday), complicating later forensic checks.
- Trajectory/Acoustics analyses: Several independent analyses argue the audio-visual sync implies a closer shot than the rooftop distance; angles from right-side/tent/tunnel/vehicle are posited.
- Alternate shooter hypotheses: Tent interior, nearby van with IR laser reflection, or other elevated positions; these are claims requiring primary-source validation.

## Key questions to resolve (non-exhaustive)
- Definitive, timestamped pathing for Robinson between 11:45–12:30 (and later in the day), with corroborating video and cellular data.
- Forensic ballistics: caliber, bullet recovery(s), entry/exit determination, and medical documentation disclosure per Utah law and case posture.
- Complete camera archives: campus, event production, and private devices—chain of custody and any deletion/alteration allegations.
- Chain-of-custody for any recovered firearm(s) and components, plus prints/DNA and purchase/ownership histories.

## Notes
- This page aggregates claims and references appearing in the project’s materials. Items tagged as “claims” or “alleged” are not vetted conclusions. Investigators should rely on primary documents (court filings, official releases, unedited footage) wherever possible.
