# Photos

## Overview
This page describes the role of **photographs and still images** in the Charlie Kirk investigation. It includes reference to official photos, media images, and pictures captured by attendees, and explains how they are used to understand the scene, movements, and claims about evidence handling. Because many photos are sensitive and subject to legal or privacy constraints, not all images are publicly available.

## Types of photographic evidence

Photographs relevant to the case include:

- **Event and media photos** – Still images from professional photographers or media outlets covering the event, capturing the stage, crowd, and surrounding environment at different moments.
- **Eyewitness photos** – Pictures taken by attendees on phones or cameras, sometimes providing unique angles on specific individuals, vehicles, or details near the tent and courtyard.
- **Post‑incident site photos** – Images showing changes to the scene, such as landscaping, paving, or structural modifications, which are often cited in discussions about evidence preservation and possible cover‑up.

These images can complement video by offering higher resolution or different perspectives.

## Uses and limitations

Photographs are used in several ways:

- To **document the layout** of the event site and positions of key people and objects at specific moments.
- To support or challenge **shooter‑location and trajectory theories** by showing sight lines, obstructions, and physical damage.
- To illustrate **before‑and‑after comparisons** of the site where physical changes may have occurred.

However, still images have limitations: they capture only a moment in time, can be subject to perspective distortion, and may lack reliable metadata if not preserved carefully.

## Access and sensitivities

Some photographs, especially those that are graphic or closely tied to medical findings, may be restricted or not released publicly due to:

- **Privacy, dignity, and legal protections** for the victim and family.
- Ongoing **investigative or evidentiary needs**, including chain‑of‑custody concerns.
- Platform or publication standards regarding sensitive content.

Where specific photos are discussed in this project, they are referenced descriptively rather than reproduced unless they are already widely public and appropriate to include.
