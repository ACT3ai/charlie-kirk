# Photos

## Overview
This directory contains photographic evidence and analysis related to the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To analyze all photographic evidence to prove that Charlie Kirk's assassination involved advanced drone technology and sophisticated intelligence operations rather than Tyler Robinson's traditional sniper rifle. This includes examining crime scene photos, evidence photos, and witness photos to identify drone activity, advanced weapon systems, and inconsistencies that expose the true assassination method and contradict the official cover-up narrative.
