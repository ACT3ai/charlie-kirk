## Overview
This directory contains information about aircraft-related aspects of the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To analyze the suspicious aircraft activity surrounding Charlie Kirk's assassination, particularly the Egyptian Air Force planes (SU-BTT and SU-BND) and the U.S. Army HADES surveillance aircraft (N1098L) that conducted unusual low-altitude passes over UVU before and after the shooting. This investigation aims to prove these aircraft were part of a coordinated intelligence operation that deployed drones and surveillance equipment to facilitate the assassination, contradicting the official lone gunman narrative.
