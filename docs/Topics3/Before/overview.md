# Before

## Overview
This directory contains information about events and circumstances that occurred before the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To investigate pre-assassination events that reveal the sophisticated planning and intelligence coordination behind Charlie Kirk's assassination, including his criticism of Israeli influence, the arrival of Egyptian aircraft, Google searches from Israeli IP addresses, and the deployment of surveillance equipment. This includes documenting the warning signs and preparatory activities that prove the assassination was orchestrated by intelligence agencies rather than a spontaneous act by Tyler Robinson.
