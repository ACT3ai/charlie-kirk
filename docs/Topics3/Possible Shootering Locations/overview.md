# Possible Shooting Locations

## Overview
This directory contains analysis of potential shooting locations related to the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To analyze all possible shooting locations to prove that the assassination was carried out using sophisticated drone technology or advanced Israeli weapons rather than a traditional sniper rifle from a rooftop. This includes investigating the South Stairs location, drone deployment zones, and other potential sites to demonstrate that the shooting required advanced intelligence coordination and contradicts the official narrative of Tyler Robinson as a lone gunman.
