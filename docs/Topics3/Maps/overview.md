# Maps

## Overview
This directory contains maps and geographic visualizations related to the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To create comprehensive maps and visualizations that demonstrate the sophisticated geographic coordination of the Charlie Kirk assassination, including aircraft flight paths, drone deployment zones, intelligence staging areas, and the relationship between UVU and Provo airport. This includes mapping the international scope of the operation to prove it was orchestrated by multiple intelligence agencies rather than a lone domestic terrorist.
