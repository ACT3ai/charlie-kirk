# Israel

## Overview
This directory contains information about Israeli connections to the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To investigate Israeli intelligence (Mossad) involvement in Charlie Kirk's assassination, particularly their motivation to eliminate Kirk after he publicly criticized Israeli influence in U.S. politics and called for the unredacted release of Jeffrey Epstein's files. This includes analyzing their coordination with Egyptian intelligence, the use of advanced Israeli weapons technology (CornerShot), and their ability to operate with diplomatic immunity while orchestrating sophisticated assassination operations on American soil.
