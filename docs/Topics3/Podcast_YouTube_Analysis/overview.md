# Podcast YouTube Analysis

## Overview
This directory contains analysis of podcasts and YouTube content related to the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To analyze podcasts and YouTube content to identify credible sources, evidence, and analysis that supports the theory of Charlie Kirk's assassination being orchestrated by intelligence agencies rather than Tyler Robinson. This includes fact-checking alternative media coverage, analyzing citizen investigators' findings, and documenting evidence that mainstream media has suppressed or censored to maintain the official cover-up narrative.
