## Overview
This directory contains video evidence and analysis related to the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To analyze all video evidence to prove that Charlie Kirk's assassination involved sophisticated drone technology and intelligence coordination rather than Tyler Robinson's traditional sniper rifle. This includes examining security footage, witness videos, and media recordings to identify drone activity, advanced weapon systems, and evidence of the true assassination method that contradicts the official narrative and exposes the cover-up.
