# List of Individuals

## Overview
This page provides a high‑level guide to **people and roles frequently mentioned** in connection with the Charlie Kirk case. It does not attempt to profile every individual or to assign guilt. Instead, it groups individuals into categories (victim, accused, investigators, witnesses, officials, and commentators) and points readers to sections where their roles are discussed in more detail. All descriptions here reflect public reporting and commentary and should be read as **context, not verdicts**.

## Central figures

- **Charlie Kirk** – The victim and central subject of this investigation. Founder and leader within TPUSA, described as a nationally influential conservative organizer. See: `Charlie` and `Motive`.
- **Tyler Robinson** – The accused suspect in official narratives. A young man charged with aggravated murder and other offenses connected to the UVU shooting. See: `Tyler Robinson` and related subpages (`Travel`, `Girlfriend`, `Trial`, `Recruited`).

## Family and close associates (as reported)

- **Family members and spouse** – Public discussion includes references to Charlie’s family and his wife, particularly around decisions about security, memorial arrangements, and privacy. Claims and commentary about their actions are covered cautiously in sections such as `Charlie` and `After`.
- **Tyler Robinson’s family and partner** – Reports discuss his parents, background, and his transgender partner, Lance Twiggs, primarily in the context of legal proceedings and alleged communications before and after the event. See: `Tyler Robinson` and `Girlfriend`.

## Law‑enforcement, legal, and institutional actors (as reported)

Various officials and institutions appear in coverage of the investigation and trial, including:

- **Law‑enforcement leadership and agents** involved in the initial response, ongoing investigation, and public briefings.
- **Judges and attorneys** associated with Tyler Robinson’s case, including defense counsel and prosecutors, as well as commentary about gag orders and courtroom transparency.
- **Medical and hospital officials** connected to emergency treatment and autopsy‑related questions.

These individuals are primarily discussed in sections like `FBI`, `Medical`, `Autopsy`, `legal_investigation`, and `Tyler Robinson/Trial`, where their roles are described based on public records and reporting.

## Witnesses, attendees, and citizen investigators

The event and its aftermath involve a wide range of other people:

- **Event attendees and witnesses** – Individuals present at the UVU event whose footage, testimonies, or interviews have contributed to public understanding and debate.
- **Citizen investigators and content creators** – Online researchers, commentators, and journalists who have compiled timelines, flight analyses, acoustic studies, and other materials used across this project.
- **Security and staff** – Members of private security teams, campus security, and event staff whose actions and positions have been scrutinized in various theories.

These groups are referenced across many sections (`Videos`, `Shooting Locations`, `Security & Law Enforcement`, `Media`, `Killer`), and their names and roles are typically introduced in those topic‑specific contexts.

## How to use this section

Rather than listing every individual by name, this page is meant to **orient readers to where people appear in the investigation**:

- Use the topical sections (e.g., `Charlie`, `Tyler Robinson`, `TPUSA`, `FBI`, `Medical`, `Killer`) to learn about specific individuals in the context most relevant to them.
- Remember that **mention in this project does not imply wrongdoing**. Many individuals are discussed because they were present, held relevant positions, or were cited in public reporting—not because they have been found responsible for a crime.

As the project evolves, if dedicated profile pages are created for key individuals or groups, they can be linked from here for easier navigation.
