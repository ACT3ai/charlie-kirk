# Witnesses, Security Personnel, and Citizen Investigators (Context Only)

## Overview

This Level_3 page provides a **neutral overview of several groups of people** who appear frequently in footage, reporting, and online analysis of the Charlie Kirk case:

- Event attendees and eyewitnesses,  
- Security and staff near the stage, and  
- Citizen investigators and content creators.

It does **not** accuse any individual of wrongdoing. Many of the names listed here appear because they have been visible in public footage, have given interviews, or have been discussed by commentators; allegations or theories involving them are treated as **claims** in specific topic sections.

## Event attendees and eyewitnesses (as reported/claims)

Various individuals present at the UVU event have drawn attention because of their proximity to key moments or their later public statements:

- **Ryne Simmons (as reported/claims):**  
  - In an X/Twitter thread by `@ninoboxer`, Simmons states that he recorded a **close‑up 4K/60fps video** of the shooting and later shared it with the FBI, who allegedly asked him to delete it. He says he retained a copy.  
  - His account is central to discussions of **video handling and censorship**, covered in [Media Censorship](../Media/Censorship.md) and [Media Narratives and Censorship After the UVU Event](../After/Media_Narratives_And_Censorship_After.md).  
- **Skyler Baird (claims):**  
  - Baird appears in multiple video angles near Charlie at the moment of the shot and later at memorial events, sometimes with media access.  
  - Online commentators have raised questions about his movements and role; these are treated as **speculative claims** in [Patsies and Distraction Actors](../Killer/Patsies_Distraction_Actors.md).  
- **Other unnamed witnesses (as reported/claims):**  
  - Many other attendees provided interviews to local and national media or shared footage on social platforms. Their contributions are referenced throughout [Videos](/Videos/overview.md), [Shooting Locations](/Shooting_Locations/overview.md), and [Media](/Media/overview.md).

These individuals are important because of **what they saw or recorded**, not because being present implies culpability.

## Security and staff near the stage (as reported/claims)

Several people visible near Charlie at the event have been singled out for closer scrutiny in online analysis:

- **Close‑protection and security staff (as reported/claims):**  
  - Names such as **Rick Cutler**, **Laine Schoneberger**, **Dan Flood**, and others appear in analyses of security posture and crowd management.  
  - Some videos and X/Twitter threads propose detailed theories about specific individuals’ movements (for example, palm‑gun or signaling hypotheses). These theories are explored—explicitly as **claims**—in [Close‑Range “Real Killer” Theories](../Killer/Close_Range_Theories.md) and [Patsies and Distraction Actors](../Killer/Patsies_Distraction_Actors.md).  
  - Independent of those theories, these individuals are documented as having **security or staff roles** at or around the event.  
- **Campus security and UVU staff (as reported):**  
  - UVU‑affiliated personnel, including **campus police officers** and event staff, appear in crowd‑control roles and logistics. Their presence and actions are discussed in [Security & Law Enforcement](/security_law_enforcement/overview.md) and [Before](/Before/overview.md).

Mention of security and staff here serves to **locate their roles in the public record**, not to draw conclusions about responsibility.

## Citizen investigators and content creators (as reported/claims)

A large part of the public understanding of this case has been shaped by **independent online investigators and commentators**:

- **Video analysts and researchers (as reported/claims):**  
  - Accounts such as `@ProjectConstitu`, `@JG_CSTT`, `@BlakeBednarz`, and others have produced **flight‑path reconstructions, acoustic studies, 3D site models, and frame‑by‑frame video analyses**.  
  - Their work is often cited in sections like [Timeline](/Timeline/overview.md), [Planes](/Planes/overview.md), [Drones](/Drones/overview.md), and [Killer](/Killer/overview.md) as examples of **citizen‑driven inquiry**, while being clearly distinguished from official investigations.  
- **Legal and political commentators (as reported/claims):**  
  - Attorneys and commentators using Substack, podcasts, and X/Twitter (for example, those who analyze gag orders or Google Trends data) have contributed legal and political framing that appears in [Motive](/Motive/overview.md), [Legal Investigation](/legal_investigation/overview.md), and [Media](/Media/overview.md).  
- **Media figures covering the case (as reported):**  
  - Public figures such as **Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and others** have discussed the case on their shows, sometimes sharing texts, clips, or interpretations that significantly influence public narratives.

These individuals are included here because their **work and commentary help shape the broader conversation** about the case, not because they are alleged to have participated in the event itself.

## How to use this page

Use this page as a **navigation aid**:

- To find where particular people are discussed in context (e.g., witness video, security posture, legal process).  
- To remember that **being named or analyzed in this project does not imply guilt**; many individuals are included because their public roles or footage are relevant to understanding what happened, not because any court has found them responsible for a crime.
