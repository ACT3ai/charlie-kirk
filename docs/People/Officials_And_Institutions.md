# Officials and Institutions Frequently Mentioned (Context Only)

## Overview

This Level_3 page summarizes **law‑enforcement, legal, medical, and institutional figures** who appear in public reporting and commentary about the Charlie Kirk case. It does **not** allege wrongdoing or assign blame. Instead, it describes:

- Their publicly reported roles, and  
- Where in this project their actions or decisions are discussed in more detail.

Allegations or criticisms involving any of these individuals are treated as **claims** in the relevant topic sections and are not endorsed as fact here.

  - Bohls is reported to have led an **early press conference** on the shooting. Commentary sometimes speculates about the timing of these leadership changes; such speculation is explored as **claims** in sections like [FBI](/FBI/overview.md) and [Motive](/Motive/overview.md).

  - News releases note that **Andrew Zenger** became CEO of **Timpanogos Regional Hospital** in August 2025, a hospital referenced in discussions of Charlie’s emergency care.  
  - Commentary sometimes speculates about the timing of his appointment; these views are treated as **claims**, not findings, in sections like [Medical](/Medical/overview.md) and [Timeline](/Timeline/overview.md).

These officials are noted here for their **professional roles** in Utah’s medical and forensic infrastructure.

## Security and event‑protection professionals (as reported)

Finally, several **security and protection professionals** appear in reporting and online investigations:

- **Private security providers (as reported/claims):**  
  - Coverage and interviews refer to firms such as **Rockhouse Integrity Group (Integrity Security Solutions)** and **Shaffer Security Group (SSG)**, as well as individuals like **Greg Shaffer** and **Brian Harpole**, in the context of TPUSA’s event security arrangements at various times.  
  - Reports describe evolving relationships between TPUSA and these firms, with some commentary questioning staffing decisions before and on the day of the UVU event. These matters are discussed—carefully—as claims in [Security & Law Enforcement](/security_law_enforcement/overview.md), [Before](/Before/overview.md), and [Killer](/Killer/overview.md).  
- **Other named security‑related individuals (as reported/claims):**  
  - Online analyses mention names such as **Laine Schoneberger, Dan Flood, and Jeff Long (UVU Police Chief)** in discussions of crowd‑control, camera placement, and close‑protection posture.  
  - Where these names appear in this project, they are presented as part of **reconstructing who was present and in what roles**, not as determinations of guilt.

As with all individuals in this section, the fact that someone is named reflects **public reporting about their involvement or position**, not a conclusion by this project that they engaged in misconduct.
