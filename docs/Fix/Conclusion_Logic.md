Determine Levels on "Current Concluded Assassin" of Charlie Kirk.



Here’s a cross-domain ladder of common thresholds/labels people use to decide “is this serious enough to act?”—from the highest bar of proof down to the loosest signal. I use U.S.-centric legal/military/intel terms where possible.

Highest → Lowest Thresholds

Beyond a reasonable doubt — criminal conviction (jury/verdict).

Admission of guilt / guilty plea — criminal case resolution by the defendant’s own admission (still under criminal standard safeguards).

Clear and convincing evidence — heightened civil/administrative standard (e.g., fraud, termination of parental rights, some injunctions, civil commitment).

Preponderance of the evidence (“more likely than not”) — ordinary civil liability, most workplace Title VII/Title IX investigations, many protective orders.

Well-founded fear — asylum standard (risk need not be “more likely than not,” but a reasonable probability).

Clear, unequivocal, and convincing — immigration/removal (used in certain deportability determinations).

Substantial evidence — administrative law / agency adjudications; enough relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept it.

Probable cause — criminal procedure: arrests, search warrants, indictments (grand jury standard).

Specific and articulable facts / Reasonable suspicion — brief stops (Terry stops), some surveillance/frisk thresholds; lower than probable cause but more than a hunch.

Reasonable belief — varied use in law enforcement/civil contexts (often similar to reasonable suspicion, depends on statute/policy).

Credible evidence / Credible information — common trigger to open or escalate an internal or administrative inquiry; not yet weighing opposing evidence.

Prima facie case — initial showing that, if unrebutted, would meet the elements (used in civil litigation and discrimination claims).

Materiality (reasonable investor test) — securities/compliance: a fact important enough that a reasonable investor would consider it.

Indictment (probable cause found by grand jury) — formal criminal charge; not a conviction, but a significant threshold to prosecute.

Information (prosecutor’s charging document) — formal charge without grand jury; relies on probable cause.

Preliminary injunction likelihood standards — civil: e.g., “likelihood of success on the merits” plus irreparable harm (varies by circuit).

Arbitrary & capricious review — judicial check on agency action: not an evidence standard to act, but a high bar to overturn government decisions.

Some evidence — minimal evidentiary floor in certain administrative or disciplinary settings (e.g., prison discipline).

Positive Identification (PID) — military ROE: sufficient certainty a target is a legitimate military objective.

Hostile act / Hostile intent — military ROE: observed act or intent authorizing engagement consistent with law of armed conflict.

Collateral Damage Estimate (CDE) with confidence level — military targeting: structured prediction of civilian harm; used with PID/ROE to decide whether to strike.

Foreign intelligence probable cause — FISA targeting: probable cause a target is a foreign power/agent (criminal PC’s cousin in national security).

National Security Letter / “Relevance” standard — intel/law enforcement: records “relevant” to an authorized investigation (below probable cause).

Specific and articulable facts (pen register / some data orders) — shows the records sought are relevant to an ongoing investigation.

Assessment → Preliminary → Full investigation (FBI tiers) — internal predicates to open/expand investigations; “assessment” can start with minimal predicate if lawful purpose exists; “full” requires more.

Analytic confidence levels (High/Moderate/Low) — intelligence community tradecraft: source reliability and corroboration statements accompanying judgments.

Likelihood language (“almost certainly,” “likely,” “possible”) — intel estimates with stated confidence (not legal proof, but disciplined signaling).

Vetted / Validated source — intelligence/HUMINT handling labels about source reliability/track record.

Derogatory information present/absent — vetting/security/HR: existence of adverse info that may justify action or closer review.

Sanctions designation standards (“reasonable basis to believe” / “credible evidence”) — used in various sanctions/denial regimes to list parties (standard varies by statute/regulation).

Watchlisting / Screening criteria — inclusion on screening lists under specified risk-based thresholds; distinct from criminal standards.

OFAC “50% rule” inference — compliance action triggered by ownership/control thresholds (not an evidence standard per se but a decisive policy threshold).

Compliance “red flags” — corporate AML/ABAC triggers that mandate enhanced due diligence or escalation.

Journalistic two-source/corroboration rule — newsroom policy threshold before publication on sensitive claims.

Platform/community “good-faith belief” — content moderation / takedown triggers under ToS or legal safe harbors.

Reasonable consumer expectation — advertising/UDAP actions; whether claims would mislead a reasonable consumer.

Safety case “as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP)” — engineering risk threshold to justify mitigation level.

Risk scoring / anomaly thresholds — fraud/abuse detection triggers (ML scores crossing an action line).

Tip / Lead — unverified report; often enough to log and screen, but not to take coercive action.

Open-source/bystander report — initial unvetted claim; may justify triage only.

Hunch / Intuition — explicitly below any action standard; may inform where to look, but not justify action.

Quick “use it how?” guide

Criminal court: #1–2 (conviction/plea), #8 (probable cause for arrest/warrant), #14–15 (charge).

Civil court: #3–4 (burden of proof), #16 (injunctions), #12 (prima facie), #7 (review of agency records).

Admin/Agency: #7, #18, #17; plus sanctions/watchlists (#30–31).

Police: #8 (arrest/warrant), #9–10 (stops/frisks).

Intel/NatSec: #22–29 (#23–25 for records/opens; #26–27 for assessments).

Military/ROE: #19–21.

Compliance/Corp: #33, #36, #32; investigations often use #4 or #11.

Media/Platforms: #34–35.

Risk/Engineering/Fraud: #37–38.

Lead-gen only: #39–41.

If you want, tell me the domains you’ll be working across (e.g., “police + intel + military”), and I’ll trim this into a role-ready checklist with examples and decision trees.
