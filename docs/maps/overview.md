# Maps

## Overview
This page explains how **maps and spatial analysis** are used in the investigation of the Charlie Kirk case. It focuses on key locations (such as the UVU campus, surrounding buildings, and relevant airports), movement paths, and how visualizing these elements helps clarify timelines and theories about shooter locations, flight paths, and travel logistics.

## Key locations and site layout

Mapping the physical environment is essential for understanding what was possible on the day of the event. Important locations include:

- The **UVU event site** – the tent, stage, audience area, and nearby structures such as tunnels, stairwells, and adjacent buildings.
+- **Rooftops and elevated positions** – areas from which a shot could have been fired according to various theories, including the official rooftop narrative and alternative balcony or building perspectives.
+- **Approach routes and parking areas** – paths used by attendees, security, and vehicles that appear in footage or are referenced in timelines.

Spatial layouts help investigators test whether proposed shooter positions, line‑of‑sight claims, and movement timelines are physically plausible.

## Movement patterns and travel routes (claims)

Maps are also used to visualize **movement before and after the event**, such as:

- Tyler Robinson’s **reported walking and driving routes** on September 10, including camera locations where he was seen and the distances between them.
- The route and timing between **UVU and other sites**, such as hospitals or the Dairy Queen mentioned in some accounts, to evaluate whether proposed timelines are realistic.
- Paths taken by key vehicles (for example, vans or private jets) that appear in flight and travel analyses.

These mapped routes support questions about whether there was enough time for certain actions to occur as described, but they do not by themselves prove or disprove any theory.

## Flight paths and regional context

Beyond the immediate campus, maps help situate:

- **Flight paths of aircraft** like N1098L and various Egyptian‑registered planes, including their proximity to UVU and the broader region.
+- **Regional geography**, such as distances between airports, cities, and other points of interest that appear in the research file.

For detailed discussion of specific aircraft and their movements, see `Planes/overview.md` and related pages.

## How to use this section

Readers can use the Maps section to:

- Orient themselves to the **physical layout** of key sites and routes.
- Cross‑check narrative claims against **distances and travel times**.
- Understand how different shooter‑location or travel theories fit—or fail to fit—the geography.

As more diagrams, screenshots, or 3D reconstructions are added, they can be linked from this page to provide visual context for the analysis in sections like `Timeline`, `Shooting_Locations`, `Tyler_Robinson`, and `Planes`.
