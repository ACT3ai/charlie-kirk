# UVU Security Cameras

## Overview
This page concentrates on **security cameras operated on the UVU campus** that may have captured relevant footage before, during, or after the Charlie Kirk event. It focuses on questions about what these cameras recorded, how the footage has been preserved, and how it can inform movement and shooter‑location analysis, without assuming any particular outcome.

## UVU camera systems and coverage

Key points about UVU’s camera systems include:

- UVU is reported to have **campus‑wide surveillance** in many common areas, including walkways, parking lots, and building exteriors.
- Some cameras may have had a view of **approach routes, crowd flows, and certain rooftops or elevated positions**, while others would be more limited.
- Not all areas—especially inside tents or in blind spots behind structures—are likely to have been covered.

Understanding which cameras exist and where they point is essential for reconstructing movements and testing claims.

## Footage availability and investigative use (claims)

Public discussion includes several questions about UVU security camera footage:

- Which **cameras were operational** on the day of the event, and what time windows are covered by retained recordings?
- Has all UVU footage relevant to the event been **preserved and provided** to investigators and defense teams, consistent with best practices and legal requirements?
- Do any UVU recordings clearly show **Tyler Robinson, potential shooter positions, or unusual activity** near the time of the incident?

These questions reflect the importance of UVU footage in either supporting or challenging various theories; they do not imply that the university has mismanaged or withheld recordings.

As more details about UVU’s camera systems and specific recordings become public, readers will be able to form a clearer picture of how campus surveillance contributes to understanding the case.
