# Security Cameras

## Overview
This page describes the role of **security camera systems** in the Charlie Kirk investigation. It focuses on cameras located on or near the UVU campus and in surrounding areas, and on questions about what footage exists, how it has been handled, and how it might clarify movements and shooter‑location theories.

## Camera types and coverage

Security‑related video sources may include:

- **Campus surveillance cameras** at UVU, covering entrances, walkways, parking areas, and some building exteriors.
- **Building‑specific cameras** that may monitor stairwells, rooftops, or interior corridors relevant to alleged access routes.
- **Nearby traffic or street cameras** that could capture vehicles and pedestrians arriving at or leaving the area.

Understanding what each camera is capable of seeing is essential for reconstructing timelines and evaluating competing accounts of where key individuals were at critical moments.

## Investigative questions about footage (claims)

Public commentary raises several recurring questions:

- Have all **relevant security camera recordings** from UVU and nearby areas been preserved, and are they available to investigators and defense counsel under proper chain of custody?
- Do existing recordings show **Tyler Robinson’s movements and presence** at or near the time of the shot in ways that support or challenge the rooftop narrative?
- Are there **unreleased camera angles**—for example, from certain rooftops, tunnels, or building edges—that could shed light on possible alternative shooter positions?

These questions are part of broader calls for transparency and are not themselves evidence that footage has been lost or suppressed.

## Relationship to other evidence

Security camera footage intersects with:

- [Videos](/Videos/overview.md) – for a broader look at all video sources, including production and eyewitness footage.
- [Shooting Locations](/Shooting_Locations/overview.md), [UVU](/UVU/overview.md), and [Maps](maps/overview.md) – for spatial and trajectory analysis that relies on camera viewpoints.
- [Tyler Robinson](/Tyler_Robinson/overview.md), [Tyler Travel](/Tyler/Travel.md), and [Timeline](/Timeline/overview.md) – for movement reconstructions that depend on time‑stamped camera sightings.

As more information about specific cameras and recordings becomes publicly available, it will be easier to see which locations and time windows are well covered and where gaps remain.
