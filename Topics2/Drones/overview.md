# Drones

## Overview
This directory contains information about drone activity related to the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To investigate the 16 drones observed at the scene and their connection to the N1098L HADES surveillance aircraft to prove that Charlie Kirk's assassination was carried out using advanced drone technology rather than a traditional sniper rifle. This includes analyzing drone capabilities, flight patterns, and their deployment by intelligence agencies to execute a sophisticated assassination operation while maintaining plausible deniability through the Tyler Robinson patsy narrative.
