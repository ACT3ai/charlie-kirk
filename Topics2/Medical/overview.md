## Overview
This directory contains medical information and analysis related to the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To investigate the medical evidence and cover-up surrounding Charlie Kirk's death, including Erika Kirk's refusal to allow an autopsy, the quick cremation of the body, and the suppression of medical reports that could reveal the true method of assassination. This includes analyzing injury patterns, medical evidence, and health records to prove that the assassination involved advanced technology and sophisticated methods that contradict the official Tyler Robinson narrative.
