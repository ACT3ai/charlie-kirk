# Suspect Before Actions

## Overview
This directory contains information about actions taken by suspects before the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To investigate the pre-incident actions of all suspects, including Tyler Robinson's possible recruitment by intelligence agencies, the Egyptian aircraft's arrival and positioning, and the surveillance aircraft's deployment to prove the sophisticated planning and coordination behind Charlie Kirk's assassination. This includes analyzing communications, movements, and preparatory activities that demonstrate the international scope and advanced intelligence operation rather than a lone domestic terrorist act.
