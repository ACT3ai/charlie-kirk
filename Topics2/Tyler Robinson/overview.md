# Tyler Robinson

## Overview
This directory contains specific information about Tyler Robinson and his involvement in the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To prove that Tyler Robinson was a patsy set up to take the blame for Charlie Kirk's assassination, analyzing the inconsistencies in his weapon (30-06 Mauser 98 would have destroyed Kirk's neck), the lack of blood evidence, and his possible recruitment by intelligence agencies. This investigation aims to demonstrate that Robinson was either framed or coerced into participating in a larger conspiracy orchestrated by sophisticated intelligence operatives using advanced drone technology and international coordination.
