# Tyler Robinson Shooting

## Overview
This directory contains detailed information about the shooting incident involving Tyler Robinson.

## Goal
To analyze the inconsistencies in the Tyler Robinson shooting narrative to prove he was not the actual assassin, including the ballistics mismatch (his 30-06 Mauser 98 would have caused massive damage), the lack of blood evidence, and the sophisticated nature of the assassination that exceeds his capabilities. This investigation aims to demonstrate that Robinson was either framed or coerced into participating in a larger conspiracy orchestrated by intelligence agencies.
