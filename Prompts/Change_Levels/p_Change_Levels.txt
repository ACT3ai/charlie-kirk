# Instructions:
* Make these changes to both CS_Before.yaml and CS_After.yaml. 
* Make these changes in the filename, link text and key_label. Update spaces as approriate.
* Look in ~/BGit/act3/charlie-kirk/Prompts/Grow_Content_Structure/p_Level_2.txt to understand things better but don't carry out those instructions.

* When doing a change, see if the destination of the change already exists. In that case, combine the two into the unified final location. Make sure there aren't any duplicate entries in Level 2 or Level 3 in the final Yaml.
