Rules for LEVEL_2 in AFTER_OUTPUT_FILE.
* This includes: LEVEL_2_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, LEVEL_2_APPROVED, LEVEL_2_REJECTED.
* Don't remove any existing values in LEVEL_2_For_REVIEW_AI_Created.
* When you add more values to LEVEL_2_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, don't create any that are duplicates in LEVEL_2_APPROVED or LEVEL_2_REJECTED.
* "Level 2" will be directory names under SITE_DOC_ROOT.
* SITE_DOC_ROOT/index.md has the homepage for the site. It includes Level 2 links in there that go out to the Level 2 pages.
* An example of a Level 2 topic is "TPUSA". That Level 2 directory is SITE_DOC_ROOT/TPUSA/.  The page for that level 2 is often "overview.md" in that Level 2 directory, and in this example it is SITE_DOC_ROOT/TPUSA/overview.md.
* Don't add or modify LEVEL_2_APPROVED or LEVEL_2_REJECTED.



Rules for LEVEL_3 in AFTER_OUTPUT_FILE.
* This includes: Level_3_Hierarchy and under it. Such as  LEVEL_3_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, LEVEL_3_APPROVED, LEVEL_3_REJECTED.
* Don't remove any existing values in LEVEL_3_For_REVIEW_AI_Created.
* When you add more values to LEVEL_3_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, don't create any that are duplicates in LEVEL_3_APPROVED or LEVEL_3_REJECTED.
* Don't add or modify LEVEL_3_APPROVED or LEVEL_3_REJECTED.
* Level 3 content are often pages (instead of directories) (but not always)
* The Level 3 content is often a markdown page in the directory for the Level 2 that is it's parent.
* The name of the Level 3 is almost never "overview.md" because that is for the Level 2 page.
* The file for a topic is a markdown file (.md)
* An example of a Level 3 "TPUSA Employees" (TPUSA_Employees) topic content page is: SITE_DOC_ROOT/TPUSA/employees.md. Where this parent is "Level 2" "TPUSA"
* Under Level_3_Hierarchy, there should only be LEVEL_3_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, LEVEL_3_APPROVED, LEVEL_3_REJECTED. If there are any LEVEL_2_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, LEVEL_2_APPROVED, LEVEL_2_REJECTED, then remove those and figure out where the content under them goes.
* Get rid of Level_3_Topics.
