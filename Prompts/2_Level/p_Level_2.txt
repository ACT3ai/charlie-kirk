   that one into the variable into THIS_LEVEL_2_DIR:
* If directories are missing to get the file path, create the directory.
* Delete the file: KEYWORDS_PARENT_DIR/THIS_LEVEL_2_DIR.keywords
* Create this file: KEYWORDS_PARENT_DIR/THIS_LEVEL_2_DIR.keywords.  We will save the content below into that file.
* Create the list of keywords to "Level 3" that this Level 2 should go to.
* Save in this .keywords file, a yaml. It has an array of "Keywords". Each entry is a "Keyword". 
* The yaml property Label is the phrase to a Level 3.  It has "_" instead of spaces. No special characters.

* The yaml property's value is the description of this.
