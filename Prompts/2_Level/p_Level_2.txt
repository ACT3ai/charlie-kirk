##########################################################

* The first thing to do is, if the file AFTER_OUTPUT_FILE  exists, then delete the file BEFORE_OUTPUT_FILE.
* Then copy the file AFTER_OUTPUT_FILE to the filename BEFORE_OUTPUT_FILE.

######## Task #############
* Make these changes to the file AFTER_OUTPUT_FILE: 

These are the LEVEL_2 Parts of the hierarchy to process:
* People
* Media
* Israel
* Tyler_Robinson
* TPUSA

* Do the following steps for each LEVEL_2 in the list above.
  * Update AFTER_OUTPUT_FILE in the Level_2_Hierarchy with anything that should be added there. Make everything under there fully correct.
  * Update AFTER_OUTPUT_FILE in the Level_3_Hierarchy with anything that should be added there. Make everything under there fully correct.
  * Add any that should be added.
  * Level_3_Hierarchy should have all of these areas filled out:
      LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_FOR_REVIEW, LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_APPROVED, LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_REJECTED, 
      Level_3_ITEMS_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, Level_3_ITEMS_APPROVED, Level_3_ITEMS_REJECTED. 

  * There should never be any "Level_3_Topics" property or in the hierarchy. Remove any that exists.




Rules for LEVEL_2 in AFTER_OUTPUT_FILE.
* This includes: LEVEL_2_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, LEVEL_2_APPROVED, LEVEL_2_REJECTED.
* Don't remove any existing values in LEVEL_2_For_REVIEW_AI_Created.
* When you add more values to LEVEL_2_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, don't create any that are duplicates in LEVEL_2_APPROVED or LEVEL_2_REJECTED.
* "Level 2" will be directory names under SITE_DOC_ROOT.
* SITE_DOC_ROOT/index.md has the homepage for the site. It includes Level 2 links in there that go out to the Level 2 pages.
* An example of a Level 2 topic is "TPUSA". That Level 2 directory is SITE_DOC_ROOT/TPUSA/.  The page for that level 2 is often "overview.md" in that Level 2 directory, and in this example it is SITE_DOC_ROOT/TPUSA/overview.md.
* Don't add or modify LEVEL_2_APPROVED or LEVEL_2_REJECTED.





Rules for LEVEL_3 in AFTER_OUTPUT_FILE.
* This includes: Level_3_Hierarchy and under it. Such as :
  * Level_3_Hierarchy should have all of these areas filled out:
      LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_FOR_REVIEW, LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_APPROVED, LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_REJECTED, 
      Level_3_ITEMS_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, Level_3_ITEMS_APPROVED, Level_3_ITEMS_REJECTED. 

* Don't remove any existing values in any of those. You can add more, or update the properties under them however.
* When you add more values to LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_FOR_REVIEW, don't create any that are duplicates in LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_APPROVED or LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_REJECTED.
  * Same with Level_3_ITEMS_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, Level_3_ITEMS_APPROVED, Level_3_ITEMS_REJECTED
* Don't add or modify any of these:
      LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_APPROVED, LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_REJECTED, 
      Level_3_ITEMS_APPROVED, Level_3_ITEMS_REJECTED. 
* Under "Level_2", list all "Key_Label"'s in the array. Don't repeat "Level_2" until switching between these higher level categories (LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_APPROVED vs LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_REJECTED, etc)




* Level 3 content are often pages (instead of directories) (but not always)
* The Level 3 content is often a markdown page in the directory for the Level 2 that is it's parent.
* The name of the Level 3 is almost never "overview.md" because that is for the Level 2 page.
* The file for a topic is a markdown file (.md)
* An example of a Level 3 "TPUSA Employees" (TPUSA_Employees) topic content page is: SITE_DOC_ROOT/TPUSA/employees.md. Where this parent is "Level 2" "TPUSA"
* Under Level_3_Hierarchy, there should only be:
      LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_FOR_REVIEW, LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_APPROVED, LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_REJECTED, 
      Level_3_ITEMS_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, Level_3_ITEMS_APPROVED, Level_3_ITEMS_REJECTED. 

   * If there are any LEVEL_2_For_REVIEW_AI_Created, LEVEL_2_APPROVED, LEVEL_2_REJECTED, then remove those and figure out where the content under them goes.
* Get rid of Level_3_Topics.
* "Level 3 Categories" (like LEVEL_3_CATEGORIES_FOR_REVIEW) are when the "items" are grouped into a cateogry vs items.  See example below in Example_Categories_vs_Items.
